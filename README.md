# Capstone-2
# 🏙️ Airbnb Bangkok Data Analysis

## 1. Project Overview

### Background

Bangkok has become one of Southeast Asia’s most visited cities, attracting millions of tourists annually.  
The rapid growth of short-term rental platforms like Airbnb has significantly influenced the city’s hospitality landscape.  
As tourism flourishes, understanding patterns in Airbnb usage is crucial for hosts, investors, policymakers, and platform managers  
to ensure sustainable and profitable participation.

### Problem Statement

Despite the platform’s popularity, there is a lack of structured insight into how Airbnb listings in Bangkok perform across neighborhoods,  
price ranges, room types, and host behaviors.  
Without this understanding, stakeholders may struggle with inefficient pricing strategies, overlooked district opportunities,  
and poorly optimized guest experiences.

---

### Key Objective

This analysis aims to provide a data-driven overview of the Airbnb landscape in Bangkok by focusing on:
- Distribution of listings and reviews across neighborhoods.
- Price range preferences of guests.
- Temporal patterns in reviews (seasonality and COVID-19 impact).
- Popularity of different room types.
- Identification of top-performing hosts based on listing volume.

## Conclusion

### Key Insights

- **Central districts dominate** in listing counts, but outer districts show growth potential.
- **Reviews peak toward the year-end**, especially in November–December, driven by tourism seasons.
- **Budget to mid-range prices (0–2000 Baht)** attract the most guest engagement.
- **Entire home/apt** listings are vastly preferred over other room types.
- A small number of **professional hosts** manage a large share of listings, indicating market centralization.

### Recommendations

1. **Expand Beyond Central Districts**  
   Encourage listing growth in underserved but accessible areas to reduce competition and expand guest options.

2. **Capitalize on Seasonal Peaks**  
   Promote listings more heavily between October–December with tailored offers to maximize visibility and bookings.

3. **Strengthen Mid-Range Offerings**  
   Improve amenities, descriptions, and pricing strategies for listings in the 1000–2000 Baht range.

4. **Prioritize Entire Home Listings**  
   Invest more in entire apartments/homes, as guests clearly favor privacy and autonomy.

5. **Monitor and Engage Superhosts**  
   Work closely with high-volume hosts to maintain platform quality, ensure regulatory compliance,  
   and gather best practices to support new hosts.

6. **Prepare for Market Disruptions**  
   Build adaptive strategies for listings to cope with external events like pandemics through long-stay options, flexible bookings,  
   and localized marketing.
